		<h1>My quest to learn Meteor</h1>
		<p> This is my first Meteor project that I have attempted on my own after completing a few Meteor tutorials.</p>
		<p>It's a simple site that uses User Accounts and basic CRUD functionality.</p>
		<p> Users can make new posts, delete posts and follow or vote on other users posts.</p>
